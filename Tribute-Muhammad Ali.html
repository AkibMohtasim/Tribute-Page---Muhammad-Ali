      <h3> Here's a time line of Muhammad Ali's life:</h3>
      <li>
        <ul>1942 -- Born Cassius Clay on January 17, in Louisville, Kentucky.
        </ul>
        <ul>1954 -- Begins training as a boxer after his bicycle is stolen. Over next six years, Clay wins six Kentucky Golden Gloves championships, two national Golden Gloves titles, and two AAU (Amateur Athletic Union) crowns.</ul>
        <ul>1964 -- On February 25, Clay goes up against favored Sonny Liston. In what will become his trademark, Clay begins taunting Liston, calling him an "ugly old bear," promising to "float like a butterfly, sting like a bee." Clay is credited with a knockout and becomes the heavyweight champion of the world after Liston fails to come out of his corner for the seventh round. Clay coins the phrase "I am the greatest!" -- a phrase for which he will forever be known.

        On February 26, Clay joins Nation of Islam, and on March 6, he changes his name to Muhammad Ali.</ul>

        <ul>1966 -- Citing his religious beliefs, Ali files for conscientious objector status and refuses to serve in U.S. military, which is involved in the Vietnam War at the time.</ul>

        <ul>1967 -- The U.S. government denies his status. Ali is convicted of draft evasion, sentenced to a maximum five years in prison and fined $10,000. The New York boxing association takes back his titles and bans him from boxing for three years. </ul>
        <ul>1970 -- The New York State Supreme Court orders his boxing license reinstated.</ul>

        <ul>1971 -- In March, Ali fights heavyweight champ Joe Frazier in Madison Square Garden, but loses after 15 rounds, in a unanimous decision.</ul>

        <ul>Later that year, Supreme Court rules in his favor, reversing the 1967 draft-evasion conviction, saying he should not have been drafted in the first place due to his religious beliefs.</ul>
        <ul>1974 -- In January, Ali beats Frazier. Later that year, he beats George Foreman in the "Rumble in the Jungle," and reclaims world heavyweight champion title.</ul>

        <ul>1975 -- Ali again faces Frazier, beats him in fight known as "The Thrilla in Manila."</ul>
        <ul>1978 -- In Februrary, Ali loses heavyweight title to Leon Spinks; regains it six months later by beating Spinks.</ul>

        <ul>1981 -- Ali loses a unanimous decision to Trevor Berbick. In December, he announces his retirement -- at age 39 -- ending his career with a professional record of 56 wins, 5 losses, 37 knockouts.</ul>

        <ul>1984 -- He is diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.</ul>

        <ul>1996 -- Ali carries the Olympic flame for Summer Games in Atlanta, Georgia.</ul>

        <ul>1997 -- Sports Illustrated names Ali Sportsman of the Century.</ul>

        <ul>2005 -- Ali is awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest U.S. civilian honor, by then-President George W. Bush.</ul>

        <ul>2009 -- Ali attends the inauguration of President Barack Obama.</ul>

        <ul>2016 -- Dies June 3 in Phoenix, Arizona. He was married four times and had nine children.</ul>
